The features selected for this database come from accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial data raw signals which were previously preprocessed according to “features_info.txt”. The present dataset includes just the mean and standard deviation estimates from the parent dataset, as well as identifiers for each subject in the experiment and each type of activity they undertook. 

Furthermore, the data has been transformed such that there is only one entry for each participant for each activity type. In the parent dataset, there were multiple observations for each of these events; here they were averaged to create a single datapoint per person, per type of activity. 

Therefore the present dataset consists of 180 total observations of 81 variables, where the prefix ’t’ always represents time data, and the prefix ‘f’ always represents frequency data. 

The following are a list of measurements computed from the original data. For a more complete explanation of how each measurement was calculated by the original experimenters, see features_info.txt:

For each of these measurements, the following were retained in the present dataset: 

mean: Mean value
std: Standard deviation

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
the suffix ’x’,’y’, or ‘z’ is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions, where applicable.

Therefore, the complete list of variables is as follows:
